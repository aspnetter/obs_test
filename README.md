✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Prerequisites

npx - npm package runner — helps to execute packages without installing explicitly.

Run `which npx` to understand if it's installed on your system

If for some reason it’s not available, install or update it as the following:

`npm install -g npx`

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Building

In the root folder, run 

`yarn` to install all the packages / dependencies

`yarn api:build` to build the api

`yarn cli:build` to build the client app

OR

`yarn all:build` to build everything at once

## Running 

The **test** forder located in the project root contains the bash script **obs_test.sh** and the sample input and output JSON files.

Run the API by executing the script without parameters: 

`sh test/obs_test.sh`

Open the new terminal and run the client CLI app specifying the **full system** paths to input and output JSON files:

`sh test/obs_test.sh <inputJsonPath> <outputJsonPath>`
